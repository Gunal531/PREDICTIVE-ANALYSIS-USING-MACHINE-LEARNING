** Steps involved :


1. Data Preparation

## Data Loading:

The code appears to load a dataset related to used cars.
The dataset includes features like on_road_old, on_road_now, years, k, rating, condition, economy, top_speed, hp, torque, and the target variable current_price.

## Data Cleaning/Preprocessing:
There's no explicit data cleaning or preprocessing shown in this snippet. However, it's likely that there would be steps like handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical variables in a real-world scenario.

2. Data Splitting

The code uses train_test_split from scikit-learn to divide the data into training and testing sets.
test_size=0.2 indicates that 20% of the data will be used for testing, while the remaining 80% will be used for training.
random_state=3 ensures reproducibility by setting a seed for the random number generator.

3. Model Training

## Model Selection:
A Linear Regression model is chosen for training.

## Model Fitting:
The LinearRegression() model is created and then fitted to the training data (X_train and y_train).

4. Model Prediction

## Predictions:
The trained model is used to make predictions on the training data itself.
The predicted values are stored in the new_predict variable.


** Observations:

-This is a basic example, and a real-world analysis would likely involve more steps like feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation on the test set.
-The code only shows the model training and prediction on the training data, which might not be a reliable indicator of the model's performance on unseen data.
-It would be beneficial to evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

** Next Steps:
Evaluate the model on the test set.
Consider feature selection and hyperparameter tuning for potential improvement.
Visualize the results to gain insights into the model's performance.
